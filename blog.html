            >Question-1: What is the difference between map, filter, forEach and
            find method in javaScript?</b
          >
        </h3>
        <b>Ans:</b>
        <p>
          <b>(i)</b> The map() method creates a new array by calling a provided
          function on each element in the original array. The new array will
          have the same length as the original array, but the values will be
          transformed by the function. It returns a new array without modifying
          the original one.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>(ii)</b> The filter() method creates a new array with all elements
          that pass the test implemented by the provided function. It returns a
          new array without modifying the original one.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>(iii)</b> The forEach() method executes a provided function once
          for each array element. It does not return a new array, and it does
          not modify the original array.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>(iv)</b> The find() method returns the value of the first element
          in the array that satisfies the provided testing function. If no
          values satisfy the testing function, undefined is returned.
        </p>

        <h3>
          <b
            >Question-2: What is the difference between local storage, session
            storage and cookies?</b
          >
        </h3>
        <b>Ans:</b>
        <p>
          <b>(i)</b> LocalStorage is a type of web storage that allows you to
          store data in the user's browser permanently. This means that the data
          will persist even after the browser is closed and reopened, and even
          after the user's computer is turned off and on again. It's a great
          option for storing data that needs to be persistent between sessions.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>(ii)</b> SessionStorage is similar to localStorage, but the data
          stored in it is cleared when the browser is closed. This makes it a
          good option for storing data that only needs to persist for a single
          browsing session.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>(iii)</b> Cookies are small data files that are stored on the
          user's computer by a website. They can be used to store data that
          needs to persist between sessions, but they have some limitations.
          Cookies have a size limit of 4KB, they can only store strings, and
          they can be accessed by both the server and the client.
        </p>

        <h3><b>Question-3: What is event loop and how does it work in javaScript?</b></h3>
        <p>
          <b>Ans:</b> The event loop is a JavaScript mechanism that enables asynchronous actions to be done without interrupting the primary execution stream. It is in charge of duties like handling human input, sending network requests, and performing callbacks. This is how it works:
        </p>
        <p>
           <b>(i)</b> When code is run, it is put to the call stack. This is a data structure  that keeps track of function calls in the sequence they are received.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>(ii)</b> A method is moved to the Web APIs if it performs an asynchronous action, such as a network request. The browser provides these Tools, such as setTimeout and retrieve, and they are not part of the JavaScript language.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>(iii)</b> If there is a pending callback function, the event loop moves it from the task queue to the call stack, where it's executed. but,If there are no pending callback functions, the event loop waits for new ones to be added.
          </p>
        <br />

        <h3>
          <b>Question-4:</b>What is a Callback Function & Wat is the use of
          callback function ?
        </h3>
        <p>
          <b>Ans:</b> A JavaScript callback is a function that is to be run
          following the completion of another function. A callback function is
          any function that is supplied as an input to another function so that
          it can be used to execute that other function, according to a more
          rigorous definition.
        </p>
        <p>
          The function of a callback is to run code in response to an event.
          Using callback, we can add wording at the end of each statement that
          says "run this code whenever the user touches a key on the keyboard."
          These events can be like mouse clicks.
