            >Question-1: What is the difference between map, filter, forEach and
            find method in javaScript?</b
          >
        </h3>
        <b>Ans:</b>
        <p>
          <b>(i)</b> The map() method creates a new array by calling a provided
          function on each element in the original array. The new array will
          have the same length as the original array, but the values will be
          transformed by the function. It returns a new array without modifying
          the original one.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>(ii)</b> The filter() method creates a new array with all elements
          that pass the test implemented by the provided function. It returns a
          new array without modifying the original one.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>(iii)</b> The forEach() method executes a provided function once
          for each array element. It does not return a new array, and it does
          not modify the original array.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>(iv)</b> The find() method returns the value of the first element
          in the array that satisfies the provided testing function. If no
          values satisfy the testing function, undefined is returned.
        </p>

        <h3>
          <b
            >Question-2: What is the difference between local storage, session
            storage and cookies?</b
          >
        </h3>
        <b>Ans:</b>
        <p>
          <b>(i)</b> LocalStorage is a type of web storage that allows you to
          store data in the user's browser permanently. This means that the data
          will persist even after the browser is closed and reopened, and even
          after the user's computer is turned off and on again. It's a great
          option for storing data that needs to be persistent between sessions.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>(ii)</b> SessionStorage is similar to localStorage, but the data
          stored in it is cleared when the browser is closed. This makes it a
          good option for storing data that only needs to persist for a single
          browsing session.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>(iii)</b> Cookies are small data files that are stored on the
          user's computer by a website. They can be used to store data that
          needs to persist between sessions, but they have some limitations.
          Cookies have a size limit of 4KB, they can only store strings, and
          they can be accessed by both the server and the client.
        </p>

        <h3><b>Question-3: What is event loop and how does it work in javaScript?</b></h3>
        <p>
          <b>Ans:</b> The event loop is a JavaScript mechanism that enables asynchronous actions to be done without interrupting the primary execution stream. It is in charge of duties like handling human input, sending network requests, and performing callbacks. This is how it works:
        </p>
        <p>
           <b>(i)</b> When code is run, it is put to the call stack. This is a data structure  that keeps track of function calls in the sequence they are received.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>(ii)</b> A method is moved to the Web APIs if it performs an asynchronous action, such as a network request. The browser provides these Tools, such as setTimeout and retrieve, and they are not part of the JavaScript language.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>(iii)</b> If there is a pending callback function, the event loop moves it from the task queue to the call stack, where it's executed. but,If there are no pending callback functions, the event loop waits for new ones to be added.
          </p>

        <h3>
          <b>Question-4: How does work quizTimer Function?</b>
        </h3>
        <p>
          <b>Ans:</b> The quizTimer function is a timer function that accepts a boolean reject argument and, if true, terminates the timer. If the dismiss argument is set to true, the method uses clearInterval to clear the interval and returns instantly. If the dismiss argument is false or is not specified, the method uses setInterval to construct an interval that calls a callback code every 1000 milliseconds.
        </p>
        <p>
          The function of a callback is to run code in response to an event.
          Using callback, we can add wording at the end of each statement that
          says "run this code whenever the user touches a key on the keyboard."
          These events can be like mouse clicks.It selects an HTML element with the ID count using document.querySelector.
          It converts the count variable to minutes and seconds format then it updates the innerHTML of the selected HTML element with the formatted time and adds a subscript "sec".
          then it increments the count variable by 1. then if the count is greater than 60, it alternates the text color of the countHtml element between red-300 and red-700 based on the value of the count variable.</p><br>

          <h3>
            <b>Question-4: How does work ChooseQuiz Function?</b>
          </h3>
          <p>
            <b>Ans:</b> The chooseQuiz function accepts two parameters, index and givenAns, which indicate the quiz number and the provided response, respectively.
            Using the find technique, the code first determines whether the question already appears in the responses array. If it exists, it cycles through the responses array and substitutes the old question with the new one, which includes the provided answer. If it does not exist, it uses the push technique to add the new question with the provided response to the answers collection.The function uses the displayAnswers function after updating the answers array and passing the answers array as an input.Overall, the chooseQuiz method enables the user to select a question and save the provided response in the answers collection. If the quiz already appears in the array, it updates the provided response; otherwise, the new quiz and given answer are added to the array.
